### **Section-Wise Question Distribution (MCQs & Numerical)**
For each subject, consider the following breakdown:

- **Section A (MCQs)**: 20 questions (from the above distribution)
- **Section B (Numerical)**: 10 questions (attempt any 5, from the above distribution)


---------------------

For JEE Mains, the math section typically follows a pattern where different topics have varying weightage. To distribute 30 questions among the topics you provided, we can assign questions in a way that reflects their importance in the syllabus. Here's a suggested distribution:

1. **Trigonometrical Ratios, Functions and Identities** - 6 questions  
   (This includes basic trigonometric identities, angles, and fundamental concepts which form the foundation for other topics.)

2. **Trigonometrical Equations and Inequations** - 5 questions  
   (These are advanced trigonometric problems focusing on solving equations and inequalities.)

3. **Inverse Trigonometric Functions** - 4 questions  
   (These are usually more conceptual and form a crucial part of calculus later on.)

4. **Differentiation** - 10 questions  
   (Differentiation is a very significant part of calculus in JEE, so a higher number of questions can be expected from this topic.)

5. **Matrices and Determinants** - 5 questions  
   (This topic is typically highly scoring, so it’s important to include several questions.)

This distribution reflects the weightage typically seen in JEE Mains, with differentiation taking a significant portion due to its importance in calculus. Let me know if you'd like to adjust the distribution or focus on any specific subtopics!
