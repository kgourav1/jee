### **Distribution of Questions**

#### **Mathematics (Total 30 Questions)**
- **Straight Lines**: 6 questions  
- **Circle**: 8 questions  
- **Limits**: 16 questions  

**Rationale**:
- **Straight Lines**: Moderate frequency and weightage in previous exams.
- **Circle**: High weightage, often linked with Coordinate Geometry.
- **Limits**: A core calculus topic that usually appears frequently.

#### **Physics (Total 30 Questions)**
- **Circular Motion**: 4 questions  
- **Newton’s Laws of Motion**: 8 questions  
- **Work, Power, and Energy**: 8 questions  
- **Center of Mass and Momentum Conservation (Collision)**: 10 questions  

**Rationale**:
- **Newton’s Laws of Motion** and **Work, Power, and Energy** are fundamental topics with high frequency in the exam.
- **Center of Mass and Momentum Conservation** is crucial and often asked in depth.
- **Circular Motion**: Typically has fewer direct questions but should be tested for conceptual clarity.

#### **Chemistry (Total 30 Questions)**
- **Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure**: 10 questions  
- **Redox Reactions and Volumetric Analysis**: 10 questions  
- **General Organic Chemistry**: 10 questions  

**Rationale**:
- These three topics are foundational in Chemistry and are interlinked, especially for Organic and Inorganic concepts. Each topic will have an equal number of questions to ensure balanced testing of core concepts.
