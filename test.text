### **Distribution of Questions**

#### **Mathematics (Total 30 Questions)**
- **Straight Lines**: 6 questions  
- **Circle**: 8 questions  
- **Limits**: 16 questions  

**Rationale**:
- **Straight Lines**: Moderate frequency and weightage in previous exams.
- **Circle**: High weightage, often linked with Coordinate Geometry.
- **Limits**: A core calculus topic that usually appears frequently.

#### **Physics (Total 30 Questions)**
- **Circular Motion**: 4 questions  
- **Newton’s Laws of Motion**: 8 questions  
- **Work, Power, and Energy**: 8 questions  
- **Center of Mass and Momentum Conservation (Collision)**: 10 questions  

**Rationale**:
- **Newton’s Laws of Motion** and **Work, Power, and Energy** are fundamental topics with high frequency in the exam.
- **Center of Mass and Momentum Conservation** is crucial and often asked in depth.
- **Circular Motion**: Typically has fewer direct questions but should be tested for conceptual clarity.

#### **Chemistry (Total 30 Questions)**
- **Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure**: 10 questions  
- **Redox Reactions and Volumetric Analysis**: 10 questions  
- **General Organic Chemistry**: 10 questions  

**Rationale**:
- These three topics are foundational in Chemistry and are interlinked, especially for Organic and Inorganic concepts. Each topic will have an equal number of questions to ensure balanced testing of core concepts.

### **Section-Wise Question Distribution (MCQs & Numerical)**
For each subject, consider the following breakdown:

- **Section A (MCQs)**: 20 questions (from the above distribution)
- **Section B (Numerical)**: 10 questions (attempt any 5, from the above distribution)


---------------------

For JEE Mains, the math section typically follows a pattern where different topics have varying weightage. To distribute 30 questions among the topics you provided, we can assign questions in a way that reflects their importance in the syllabus. Here's a suggested distribution:

1. **Trigonometrical Ratios, Functions and Identities** - 6 questions  
   (This includes basic trigonometric identities, angles, and fundamental concepts which form the foundation for other topics.)

2. **Trigonometrical Equations and Inequations** - 5 questions  
   (These are advanced trigonometric problems focusing on solving equations and inequalities.)

3. **Inverse Trigonometric Functions** - 4 questions  
   (These are usually more conceptual and form a crucial part of calculus later on.)

4. **Differentiation** - 10 questions  
   (Differentiation is a very significant part of calculus in JEE, so a higher number of questions can be expected from this topic.)

5. **Matrices and Determinants** - 5 questions  
   (This topic is typically highly scoring, so it’s important to include several questions.)

This distribution reflects the weightage typically seen in JEE Mains, with differentiation taking a significant portion due to its importance in calculus. Let me know if you'd like to adjust the distribution or focus on any specific subtopics!


Here’s a suggested distribution of 30 questions across the three physics topics you provided for JEE Mains preparation:
