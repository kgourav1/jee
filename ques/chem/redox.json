  {
    "question": "In a redox reaction, if the oxidation number of a reactant increases, what happens to that reactant?",
    "choice1": "It is oxidized",
    "choice2": "It is reduced",
    "choice3": "It remains unchanged",
    "choice4": "It is a spectator ion",
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "If the oxidation number of a reactant increases, it means the reactant has lost electrons and is therefore oxidized."
