    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The velocity of the center of mass \\( V_{cm} = \\frac{m_1v_1 + m_2v_2}{m_1 + m_2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 4 + 2 \\cdot (-6)}{3 + 2} = \\frac{12 - 12}{5} = 0 \\) m/s."

    "choice4": "4 m/s",
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Using conservation of momentum, \\( m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 = (m_1 + m_2)v_f \\). Thus, \\( (2 \\times 3 + 0) = (2 + 4)v_f \\), giving \\( v_f = 1 \\) m/s."

    "choice3": "3 m/s",
    "choice4": "1 m/s",
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "In an elastic collision with equal masses, the velocities are exchanged. Thus, the final velocity of the first ball becomes 0 m/s."

    "choice2": "1 m/s",
    "choice3": "2 m/s",
    "choice4": "4 m/s",

    "choice2": "0.5 m/s",
    "choice3": "1 m/s",
    "choice4": "2 m/s",
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Using conservation of momentum, \\( m_{bullet}v_{bullet} + m_{block}v_{block} = (m_{bullet} + m_{block})v_f \\). If the bullet's velocity is 300 m/s, then \\( (0.02 \\cdot 300 + 2 cdot 0) = (0.02 + 2)v_f \\), giving \\( v_f = \\frac{6}{2.02} \\approx 0.1 \\) m/s."
